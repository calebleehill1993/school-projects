          "Okay, for what it's worth!
      A picture postcard shot of an English village shot on summers day.
      The composition is great and the people add interest 10/10
      However I'm not a fan of this sort of processing - sorry
      For me the colours are over saturated and unreal.
      If you are started a photography journey don't go down this road, In few years time you'll look back and shake your head.
      Boom"

          "When shooting virtually any cityscape/landscape image during relatively bright conditions, you can seldom go wrong with selecting ISO 100 and expose in a burst with + and - one stop exposure bracketing. Most cameras can do this without any additional work beyond selecting burst and bracketing...

          I know that many folks shudder when exposure bracketing is mentioned but I could hand a camera to anyone who has never shot a photo in their lives and recommend the bracketing using ISO 100 during bright and ISO 400 during darker conditions. Using a tripod for night cityscape images shooting at ISO 400 while bracketing up and down one stop with a minus one stop exposure compensation will put you in the ballpark. BTW: the bane of many night shots is the over exposure of brighter areas, this system will give you one shot as the meter reads, one shot a stop under and one shot two stops under the meter reading. Guarantee that one of those three will be in the ballpark...

          I was amazed many years ago when I attended a lecture by a National Geographic Photographer who shot this way using 35mm Kodachrome II film. It was an expensive way to shoot and I never did so until I shot digital when every exposure didn't cost money...

          BTW: for many who say that you cannot "learn" photography shooting this way, I contend that it is an excellent way to learn because you will be viewing the results of exposure change when you view your images in the editing program...

          Do I shoot this way? Seldom but, the Sony cameras will show me the results before I press the shutter button. I just have to realize what good exposure looks like...

          "Caleb, I liked your photo very much. You have received a lot of information in your thread. I don’t have information but I can provide you with some advise. You stated,”Also, I don't think I really understand what aperture does.” A year and a half ago I didn’t know ether. The most important thing for you to learn is your camera. I suggest you put your focus there. Much success in your photographic endeavors.
